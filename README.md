# UC-Berkeley-AI-P3

## Project Overview

The Pacman AI project is a series of programming assignments designed to introduce students to key concepts in artificial intelligence using the classic video game Pacman as a platform. The project covers a range of topics, from basic search algorithms to more advanced techniques like reinforcement learning. Through these assignments, students get hands-on experience implementing AI algorithms and strategies to control the behavior of the Pacman character in various scenarios.

## Project Components

The project is structured around several key components, each addressing specific AI concepts:

### 1. Search Algorithms

The initial assignments focus on search algorithms, which are crucial for decision-making in uncertain environments. Students implement algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* search to find optimal paths for Pacman to navigate through mazes.

### 2. Adversarial Search

Adversarial search assignments delve into game-playing strategies when facing opponents. Students develop agents using minimax and alpha-beta pruning techniques to make optimal decisions in games with adversarial elements, such as avoiding ghosts while collecting pellets.

### 3. Value Iteration

Value iteration assignments introduce the concept of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and value iteration algorithms. Students implement algorithms to compute optimal state values and policies for Pacman to maximize rewards while navigating the maze.

### 4. Q-Learning

The Q-learning assignments focus on reinforcement learning, where Pacman learns from trial and error. Students implement Q-learning agents that learn action-value functions based on rewards and transitions between states. This enables Pacman to adapt its behavior to achieve higher rewards over time.

### 5. Approximate Q-Learning

In advanced assignments, students explore approximate Q-learning using feature extraction. Instead of directly representing every state-action pair, students design feature extractors to map states to a set of features. This reduces the complexity of learning and improves efficiency.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout the Pacman AI project, students gain a deep understanding of various AI concepts and techniques, including:

- **Search Algorithms**: Understanding different search algorithms and their applications in solving problems.
- **Adversarial Search**: Learning how to make optimal decisions in games with opponents.
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Understanding the concepts of states, actions, rewards, and transitions in decision-making scenarios.
- **Value Iteration**: Implementing algorithms to compute optimal policies for MDPs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring the basics of reinforcement learning and Q-learning algorithms.
- **Approximate Q-Learning**: Designing feature extraction methods to facilitate efficient learning.

## Usage and Assessment

Students complete the assignments by implementing various agents and algorithms in Python. They then test these agents in different maze scenarios and analyze their performance. The project often comes with autograders that provide immediate feedback on the correctness of the implementations.

## Conclusion

The Pacman AI project offers a comprehensive and engaging way for students to explore AI concepts through hands-on programming. By controlling Pacman's behavior in a simulated environment, students gain insights into the challenges and strategies involved in creating intelligent agents. This project is not only educational but also fun, allowing students to see AI in action within a familiar and enjoyable context.
